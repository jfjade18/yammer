      # @option options [String] :letter Return users beginning with the given letter.
      # @option options [String] :sort_by [ messages | followers ] Results will be returned sorted by number of messages or followers, instead of the default behavior of sorting alphabetically.
      # @option options [Boolean] :reverse Return results in reverse order.
      # @option options [Boolean] :delete The DELETE method on a user resource will suspend that user's account, allowing the user to reactivate through the website if they have access to a company email address.
